Project Purpose
The purpose of these projects is to demonstrate my experience transitioning from software development to data analysis. By showcasing my proficiency in Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, numpy, and openpyxl, I aim to highlight my ability to perform various data manipulation, analysis, and visualization tasks.

Running the Notebooks
To explore and run the Jupyter Notebook files included in this project, follow the steps below:

Install Python and Jupyter Notebook on your machine if you haven't already.
Clone or download this project repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
Launch Jupyter Notebook by running the command jupyter notebook.
In the Jupyter Notebook interface, browse to the notebooks/ directory and open the desired notebook file.
Execute the notebook cells sequentially to see the code and corresponding outputs.
Excel Files
As part of the data visualization process, the notebook files include functionality to export visualizations to Excel files using the openpyxl library. The resulting Excel files can be found in the visualizations/ directory. These Excel files contain the visualizations in a format that can be easily shared and accessed by others.

Feel free to explore the notebooks and Excel files to gain insights into my data analysis capabilities and approach.

If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Enjoy exploring the projects!
